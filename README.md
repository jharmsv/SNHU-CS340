# SNHU-CS340
# This project is an interactive MongoDB/Dash dashboard, used for identifying and managing rescue dog candidates for Grazioso Salvare.

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
### Code maintainability was achieved through adherence to the principle of structure and simplicity. By implementing an Object-Oriented Design (OOD), the MongoDB interaction logic—encapsulated within the CRUD Python module was strictly separated from the dashboard’s presentation layer. This crucial architectural separation, combined with clear, parameterized methods (Create, Read, Update, Delete), ensures the module is highly reusable. It can be effortlessly adapted for future database-centric projects, whether for new analytics dashboards or for deployment with other organizations.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist
### My development process began with analysis and decomposition, breaking the overall project into distinct, testable components. The work was systematic and modular, first prioritizing reliable database connectivity via the CRUD module. This foundational step was followed by building the visualization layer iteratively: first, ensuring data retrieval, then implementing dynamic filtering, and finally integrating the interactive map features. Moving forward, I will continue to rely on this approach of iterative prototyping—testing and refining each feature—to efficiently satisfy client needs.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
### The essence of computer science is transforming raw data into actionable decision-making tools. For Grazioso Salvare, this principle is realized through an intuitive dashboard that allows trainers to instantly identify high-potential rescue dogs. My work directly supports their mission by amplifying the real-world impact of their data, effectively bridging the gap between information and life-saving action.
